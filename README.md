# 🛠️ DIY 3D Printer Build

This repository documents my senior project: building a fully functional Cartesian-style FDM 3D printer from scratch. The goal was to gain a deep understanding of 3D printer hardware and firmware by constructing and tuning a custom machine using off-the-shelf components and open-source tools.
